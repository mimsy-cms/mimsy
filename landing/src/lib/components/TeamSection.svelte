					We're a small bunch of (for now) students at HEIG-VD who got frustrated with the repetitive nature of CMS development. Instead of building yet another WordPress site or wrestling with overcomplicated headless solutions, we decided to create something that actually makes sense.
				</div>
				
				<div>
					No fancy offices, no venture capital, no corporate buzzwords. Just a group of developers who want to build tools that work the way developers think.
				</div>
				
				<div>
					We believe in code as the source of truth, zero-downtime deployments, and keeping things simple. That's why mimsy exists - because we were tired of the same problems, and we knew there had to be a better way.
